  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>Recently, I wanted to create a cool project inspired in those fancy projects made in Three.js but, I encountered two problems.</p>
  <br>
  <ol>
    <li><p>I can't model because I suck <i>haha</i></li>
    <li><p>my javascript skills are not exactly out of the roof</p></li>
  </ol>
  <p>However, I was really decided to advance with the idea. Well, long story short, I wanted to create a viewing insects type website because in one of my jobs (the cleaning pools one) my boss asked me if I knew about web development which I might have and, "web positioning" (which i don't have a clue yet), therefore, if I can't model, i'll have to <i>steal them</i> hence, <b>steal is what I did</b> so will be able to impress him in the future :)).</p>
